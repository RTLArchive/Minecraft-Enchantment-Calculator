# Minecraft Enchantment Calculator

Minecraft Enchantment Calculator is an open source website for calculating the probability of getting a chosen enchant in Minecraft.

The site is live [here](http://minecraftenchantmentcalculator.com).  Feel free to hack around with the source, it's a bit of a mess right now but I will get around to cleaning it up soon.  I make sure to read all pull requests and issues, but due to work and school I am usually unable to get things fixed immediately.

The calculator is written using jQuery, and uses the algorithm described [here on the Minecraft Wiki](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantment_Mechanics).

I no longer accept donations for this project, however there is an official iOS app for the calculator [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enchantment-calculator-for/id763850739?ls=1&mt=8) if you're feeling generous!
